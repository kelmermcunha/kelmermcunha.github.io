<p style="text-align: center;">In addition to neglect, the Neotropical funga face several human-induced threats that are rapidly pushing species on the brink of extinction – at a much faster pace than we can discover and formally describe new species. To this concern, my research also focuses on assessing fungal species extinction risk based on the IUCN criteria, identifying species that are in urgent need of actions to avoid their disappearance. Following threatened species recognition, I seek to conserve the genetic diversity of these species in an ex-situ conservation strategy at CFAB MIND.Funga.</p>


# Past projects
## South Brazilian Highland Grasslands soil fungal conservation and ecology
#### Fungi are among the most rich and essential groups on Earth.
Yet, most of its diversity and ecological aspects are still unknown.

###### This holds especially for the Neotropical region. My undergraduate research focused on understanding which fungal species dwell in the soils of the Campos de Cima da Serra grasslands – an endangered formation that has been shaped by fire and grazing since the mid-Holocene. I also focused on understanding how these unknown fungal communities are structured locally.

# Past projects

### Soil fungal conservation and ecology
#### Fungi are among the most rich and essential groups on Earth.
Yet, most of its diversity and ecological aspects are still unknown.

{% include module.html image_path="/assets/images/campo_site.png" title="" description="This holds especially for the Neotropical region. This project was developed for my undergraduation thesis and focused on understanding which fungal species dwell in the soils of the Campos de Cima da Serra grasslands â€“ an endangered formation that has been shaped by fire and grazing since the mid-Holocene. I also focus on understanding how these unknown fungal communities are structured locally." %}
